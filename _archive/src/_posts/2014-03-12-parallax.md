description: Subtle Parallax and other Scroll effects to breath life into your site.
---

It seems like every other project I start these days, the word parallax comes up, and it is all over Square Space's commercials. If you don't know what this effect is go ahead and look <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax" target="_blank">here</a>. I don't mind this fad but I do think people tend to go overboard with it. Also there are other effects that can be triggered on scroll which can subtly breath life into your site without making anyones head spin.

<!--more-->

####Effect 1: Position
The first example is subtle parallax effect. There are many ways to do this and many libraries to help out, but I will show you a few different effects using different means.

first create an element for the effect.

~~~~~html
<div class="splash">
	<h1>Hello World</h1>
</div>
~~~~~

Then add the image as a background of that element and position it however you desire

~~~~~css
.splash{
	height:600px;
	width: 100%;
	overflow: auto;
	background:url(ex1.jpg) top center no-repeat;
	background-size: 150% auto;
}
~~~~~

Now lets add the effect. I am using jQuery in case you didn't notice.

~~~~~javascript
var yOffset = 0;
var speed = 2;
var $parallaxContainer = $('.splash');
$(window).scroll(function() {
	var pos = $parallaxContainer.offset();
	var topOffset = pos.top;
	if ( ($(window).scrollTop() + $(window).height()) > (topOffset) && ( (topOffset + ($parallaxContainer.height()*2 )) > $(window).scrollTop() ) ) {
		var yPos = -($(window).scrollTop() / speed);
		yPos += yOffset;
		$parallaxContainer.css({ backgroundPosition: 'center '+ yPos + 'px' });
	}
});
~~~~~

So basically the first if statement checks that we are scrolling somewhere within the element. Then calculate that amount to shift the position of this image based on how much we scroll divided by the speed variable, so in this case, half distance. Then set the background position through css.

<div class="center">
<a href="{{site.data.s3.demo}}parallax/ex1" target="_blank" class="btn btn-large">View Effect</a>
</div>

####Effect 2: Opacity
Instead of changing the position of our image, why not the text. Oh and what about some opacity.

So lets position our text in the center of the element

~~~~css
.splash h1{
	z-index: 100;
	position: relative;
	color:#fff;
	font-size: 72px;
	line-height: 72px;
	margin: 0;
	margin-top:-36px;
	width: 100%;
	height:72px;
	text-align: center;
	top:50%;
}
~~~~

We know the height of our text so we can center it vertically with the old negative margin trick.

~~~~javascript
var yOffset = 0;
var speed = 0.4;
var scrollEnd = 100;
var o = 1;
var $parallaxText = $('.splash > h1');
var originalPos = $parallaxText.offset().top;
$parallaxText.css({
	top: originalPos + "px"
});
$(window).scroll(function() {
	offset = $(window).scrollTop();
	var pos = $parallaxText.offset();
	var topOffset = pos.top;
	if(scrollEnd/offset < 1.5 && scrollEnd/offset > 0){
		var newPos = originalPos + (offset*speed);
		o =(Math.round((scrollEnd/offset) * 100) / 100);
		$parallaxText.css({
			top: newPos + "px",
			opacity: o
		});
 	}
});
~~~~

So this is basically the same as last time but now we are altering the position of the text and calculating a decimal value for our opacity.

<div class="center">
<a href="{{site.data.s3.demo}}parallax/ex2" target="_blank" class="btn btn-large">View Effect</a>
</div>

####Effect 3: Blur
I like this effect where the image blurs out of focus as you scroll away from it. But I kinda use some trickery to accomplish it so it needs a little more explanation.

While you can blur images using <a href="http://html5-demos.appspot.com/static/css/filters/index.html" target="_blank">CSS filters</a>, and it is very neat stuff, I don't think it is the move here. CSS filters are pretty taxing on performance, and since we are constantly changing the amount of blur on scroll that method is not going to be pretty. So I take the original image, bring it into Photoshop or ImageMagick or whatever, blur it to my hearts desire and save a copy. I then overlay the two images on top of each other and fade between them on scroll.

The HTML.

~~~~html
<div class="splash">
	<h1>Hello World</h1>
	<div class="splash-img"></div>
	<div class="splash-img-blur"></div>
</div>
~~~~

The CSS.

~~~~css
.splash,
.splash-img,
.splash-img-blur{
  height:700px;
  width: 100%;
  overflow: auto;
}
.splash{
	position: relative;
}
.splash-img, .splash-img-blur{
  position: absolute;
  top:0;
  left:0;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: center center;
  -webkit-background-size: cover;
  -moz-background-size: cover;
  -o-background-size: cover;  background-size: cover;

}
.splash-img{
	background-image:url(ex3a.jpg);
}
.splash-img-blur{
	opacity: 0;
	background-image:url(ex3b.jpg);
}
~~~~

And our effect.


~~~~javascript
var offset;
var scrollEnd = 200;
function blurImage(amount){
	$('.splash-img-blur').css({
		opacity : amount
	})
}
$(window).scroll( function(e) {
	offset = $(window).scrollTop();
	if(offset/scrollEnd < 1.5){
		blurImage(offset/scrollEnd);
	}
});
~~~~

So in this case, rather than apply the blur effect across 100% of the height of the element we are just setting it on a fixed number. so once you scroll 200 pixels the blur image will be completely visible. If your element is not at the top of the page you will need to add an offset like the first example. Also we are checking it against 1.5 instead of 1 to give it a little buffer.

<div class="center">
<a href="{{site.data.s3.demo}}parallax/ex3" target="_blank" class="btn btn-large">View Effect</a>
</div>

Sweet, thats all.

Note also, we are doing these right on the scroll events, if you are really concerned about performance you should move them to request animation frame. Maybe I will do something on that in the future. Until then See this article.
