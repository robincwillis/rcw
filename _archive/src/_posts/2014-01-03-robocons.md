Every designer has there own curated / authored and tweaked collection of go to icons for various UI elements, I decided to collect and release my own.

Robocons is constantly evolving set of icons (80 and counting) that I develop in response to common User Interface needs that appear during development. Icon's range from basic navigational elements, media controls to quirky characters and include different weights in some cases. It is completely free, open source and comes in SVG TTF WOFF and EOT.
