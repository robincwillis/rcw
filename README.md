#Development

<strike>

	> grunt dev

is gonna build src/css from src/sass

run it

so I think grunt-jekyll is broken and can't deal right now. This works though

1. in root run grunt dev

2. in /development run jekyll serve

or

2. in /src run jekyll serve (but the grunt command will cause jekyll update builds to go to /development so you wont see changes here)


</strike>

no dont do any of this, just do

	> grunt serve

go to

http://localhost:8000/

now you can edit files in /src and see the site regenerated in /development

#Production

what is this?

#Deploy

> git push deploy master ?
