#[Robocons](http://robincwillis.github.io/SketchWire/)

A constantly evolving set of icons (80 and counting) that I develop in response to common User Interface needs that appear during development. Icon's range from basic navigational elements, media controls to quirky characters and include different weights in some cases. It is completely free, open source and comes in SVG TTF WOFF and EOT.

#[Hijack Player](http://robincwillis.github.io/SketchWire/) **done

A small web app to stream playlists of audio through the browser, optimized for mobile devices and webkit. I developed this basically because I was sick of having to leave my phone hooked up to someone's stereo when I wanted to play or stream a song for a bunch of people. Most html5 audio and video players focus on cross browser compatibility and graceful degradation when html5 audio is not supported. This is all fine and good but for this purpose I don't really care so I set out to make my own little lightweight player.

#[Google Maps Trace](http://robincwillis.github.io/SketchWire/)

Google Maps Trace makes it easy to align custom image overlay geometry with an underlying Google Map and retrieve the bounds for that overlay. I had a couple of projects that wanted to use the navigation and geographical features of Google Maps but with total custom geometry and styles for features such as land, roads, buildings etc. Luckily this is easily accomplished using image overlays with svg/png fallback. Unfortonuly there aren't any simple tools out there to align the overlay's geometry with Google Map's. That's where this comes in.

#[Custom Mapper](http://robincwillis.github.io/SketchWire/)

	--Update Demo

	Often times projects demanded the same degree of customization and behavior from Google Maps in terms of Appearance. This can all be accomplished through Google Maps API, but rather than build these custom maps over and over again this is an attempt at packaging that functionality into a couple of classes which provide an easy interface for custom styles for the map, custom Marker images including hover and selected states, dynamic html content in Markers, custom infoboxes for each marker. All of the map and marker data, styles and content are loaded from json object to generate the custom map.

#[Fluid Gallery](http://robincwillis.github.io/SketchWire/)
	--Updated from ikb?

	A new take on the popular scrolling image galleries. This jQuery plugin takes all of images within an element and sets every landscape image too 100% width of it's container and for every portrait image divides that container between it and its next sibling while staggering right to left.

#[Mockup](http://robincwillis.github.io/SketchWire/)
	--Update Demo
	--Some Graphic explaining

	We sweat the details. This jQuery plugin allows you to overlay your design comps over your actual website while you develop to ensure they visually perfect. Simply add a set of img tags containing your design mockups in the document to a certain element and call Mockup on that element. Through keyboard controls you can toggle each of these images visibility, adjust opacity, adjust its positioning and more.

##[WebGLStage](http://robincwillis.github.io/WebGLStage/)
A simple stage for viewing 3d models in WebGL. Accepts any format three.js accepts, .json, .json.bin, .obj, .dae, .stl etc. Uses an ajax request to load the models, so if you are running this locally you will need to open it from a web server or your likely to have a security issue.

##[SketchWire](http://robincwillis.github.io/SketchWire/)
###Sketch In 3D.

While working on a series of 3d modeling applications I developed a set of classes to aid correctly and intuitively translating 2d mouse coordinates from the screen to the 3d application space. Sketchwire is a basic package of those classes that lets you sketch lines in 3d space while panning, rotating and zooming that space simultaneously.

##[CharCycle](http://robincwillis.github.io/CharCycle/)
JQuery plugin to create a cycling effect on selected text at some event.

This effect is inspired by the classic actionscript effect on yugop.com. Attach the plugin to the element you want to trigger the cycling, specify the target text you want to produce the effect and include a conditional statement to ensure that cycling isnâ€™t re-triggered while the effect is in progress.
