I just published 3 lightweight JQuery plugins. Check out
###[CharCycle](http://robincwillis.github.io/CharCycle/)
jQuery plugin to cycle through characters on an event. This effect is inspired by the classic actionscript effect on [yugop.com](http://yugop.com).
###[AutoScroll](http://robincwillis.github.io/AutoScroll/)
an incredibly small and simple JQuery plugin that allows overflowing elements with lists scrollable based on the vertical mouse position within that element.
###[SlidePanel](http://robincwillis.github.io/SlidePanel/)
a JQuery plugin that allows elements to expand and collapse creating a sliding panel effect.
