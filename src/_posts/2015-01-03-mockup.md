Typically frontend developers get mockups or comps from a designer in some adobe format and set out building the interface for that application based on the specification. Adobe files are nice because you can check the document for font sizes, letter spacing, guides that provide hints about the grid system etc. But sometimes you only get jpegs and matching those details within the design is kinda like guess work.

For these cases I created Mockup. Check it out!
