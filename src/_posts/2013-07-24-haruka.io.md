#### a Japanese to English Slang Dictionary

I just launched Haruka, my first Ruby on Rails app!

Japanese Slang is constantly mutating and growing and speeds which make conventional dictionaries maintained by specific authorities burdensome or impossible to keep up with. Words are constantly being shortened, combined and invented. Haruka aims the be the simple and definitive Japanese to English slang dictionary by opening its doors to anyone willing to contribute.
###What makes Haruka Awesome?
1. A fully searchable database of terms including Kanji, Kana, definitions, literal translations and additional descriptions.
2. Keep track of terms you authored and add other terms to your personal list of favorites.
3. Vote terms up and down to give a sense of accuracy.
4. Flag irrelevant content.
5. Ability to add pictures, comments and phrases to terms.
6. Create associations between related terms.
7. Simple, beautiful responsive design adapts across all browsers, mobile devices and tablets.
8. Environment Variables allow you to easily customize and deploy to your own server.
