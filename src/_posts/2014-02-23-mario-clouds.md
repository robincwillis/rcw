Back in 2002 Cory Archangel made [this awesome project](http://www.coryarcangel.com/things-i-made/supermarioclouds/) where he took out everything from Super Mario Brothers but the looping clouds in the background. A bit different, this experiment randomly generates and scrolls clouds from Super Mario across an html 5 canvas forever.
