Mockup


Typically when I do consulting work I get mockups or comps from a designer in some adobe format and set out building. I can check the document for font sizes, letter spacing, information about the grid system etc. But sometimes I only get jpegs and matching the intention of the design is kinda like guess work. For this I started mockup. It basically lets you through all those comps into a folder, reference them in the dom, and then toggle an overlay ontop of the site that you are coding. That way you can check to make sure your implementation of sed designs are pixel perfect, and tweak things as needed on the fly.
