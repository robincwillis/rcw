Promises are in my, and probably many other developers, opinion the best way to manage asynchronous application flows while writing clear maintainable code and avoiding race conditions.

Promises in fact are in the [Javascript API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise), but it's still experimental and browser support is [slim to none](http://caniuse.com/#feat=promises). There are also great libraries out there, I like [Q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q), and [jQuery](https://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/). However both of these libraries do a lot more than I really want from Promises(pretty much just ```when``` and ```then```).So I wanted set out to write my own Promise API with the goal of being super light, super simple and stripped down feature-wise, with the smallest footprint I could create. Here it is. Here it is.

This is how you use it.

~~~javascript
    function asyncEvent(){
        var dfd = new Deferred();
        setTimeout(function(){
            dfd.resolve("hip hop");
        }, Math.floor(Math.random()*1500));
        return dfd.promise();
    };

    function asyncEvent2(){
        var dfd = new Deferred();
        setTimeout(function(){
            dfd.resolve('hurray');
        }, Math.floor(Math.random()*1500));
        return dfd.promise();
    };

    Deferred.when(asyncEvent(), asyncEvent2()).then(
        function(status1, status2){
            console.log(status1 +" : "+ status2 + ', resolved');
        },
        function(status1, status2, status3){
            console.log(status1 + status2 + ', failed');
        }
    );
